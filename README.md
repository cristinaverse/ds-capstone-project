Applied Data Science Capstone

This capstone project serves as the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. It consolidates the key concepts and skills developed throughout the specialization into a comprehensive, real-world project.

Project Overview

The project centers around SpaceX, a leading private aerospace company known for making space missions more cost-effective. One major factor contributing to its cost savings is the reuse of the Falcon 9 rocketâ€™s first stage. While a typical launch may cost around $62 million with SpaceX, competitors may charge more than $165 million per launch. Since reusability is a critical cost driver, predicting whether the first stage will successfully land is essential for estimating launch expenses. This project uses public data and machine learning to forecast the likelihood of a successful landing.

Key Research Questions

How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of previous flights, and orbit type impact the landing success of the first stage?
Has the frequency of successful landings improved over time?
Which classification algorithm provides the most accurate predictions for this scenario?
